When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	Using a remote repository makes it possible to share a project with other people and work on the other computer.

hy might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forking is like copying and making my own version of a repository on the GitHub. Cloning is much like the fork, because it can copy a repository on the GitHub into the local machine. Branches are the diffrent versions of local project.
